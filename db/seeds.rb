<p>Hashing algorithms are one of the core tools in password security. They are functions that take an input (or ‘message’) and returns a fixed-size alphanumeric string. The string is called the ‘hash value’, ‘message digest’, ‘digital fingerprint’, ‘digest’ or ‘checksum’).</p>
<p>The ideal hash function has three main properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is extremely easy to calculate a hash for any given data.</li>
<li>It is extremely computationally difficult to calculate an alphanumeric text that has a given hash.</li>
<li>It is extremely unlikely that two slightly different messages will have the same hash.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this exercise, you are going to implement the <code>bcrypt</code> hashing algorithm for user registration. The input is a password, a string. The output should be the password hashed with bcrypt.</p>
