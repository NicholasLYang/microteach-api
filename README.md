## About 

Microtea.ch (or Microteach) is a website dedicated to teaching programming
through microservices. Microservices are small scalable services that are meant
to be composed and individually scalable. This allows for more fine grained
control of computing resources and (theoretically) more durable applications.
Microtea.ch takes this idea of services and applies them to programming
exercises. For instance, an exercise on hashing a password will be turned into
microservices for a blog's login system. Or an exercise for sorting into a
sorter for a todo list site. These microservices are hosted on stdlib, with each
microtea.ch user getting to keep their microservices on their own stdlib
account.


## Inspiration

I've always had an issue with programming teaching websites. Sites like
CodeCademy are stylish, cool, and extremely boring to me. Part of the issue is
none of the exercises actually lead to anything. They just end up giving you
imaginary points. And while I love imaginary points like anyone else, it just
doesn't do it for me. Trying to come up with a better way to teach programming,
I was inspired by the concept of a ham radio kit. Ham radio kits teach
electronics and basic soldering, but they also give the user a gift at the end:
a ham radio. By giving users a gift in the form of microservices that they can
use to create their own projects, microtea.ch brings back the idea of ownership
to programming education.

## Misc.

Microtea.ch was created at Hack Princeton. It won the stdlib sponsor prize.
I may revisit it later, as I do actually like the idea a lot. We'll see.
